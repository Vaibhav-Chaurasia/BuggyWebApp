        click on a link which takes you back to a spoof web site that looks similar to 
        your bank&#39;s website, wherein you are asked to provide, update or confirm 
        sensitive personal information. To prompt you into action, such emails may 
        signify a sense of urgency or threatening condition concerning your account.

        <br class="style17" />
    <br class="style17" /></span></b><span class="style19">The information most commonly sought through such means are:

        <ul>

        <span class="style20">
    <br class="style18" /></span><span class="style19">Some fake emails may also contain a virus known as a &quot;Trojan horse&quot; that can 
        record your keystrokes or could trigger background installations of key logging 
        software or viruses onto your computer.The virus may live in an attachment or be 
        accessed via a link in the email.

    <br /><strong><span class="style21">Counterfeit Web sites</span></strong><br />
    <br /><span class="style22">Online thieves often direct you to fraudulent Web sites via email and pop-up 
        windows and try to collect your personal information. One way to detect a phony 
        Web site is to consider how you arrived there. Generally, you may have been 
        directed by a link in a fake email requesting your account information. However, 
        if you type, or cut and paste, the URL into a new Web browser window and it does 
        not take you to a legitimate Web site, or you get an error message, it was 
        probably just a cover for a fake Web site
